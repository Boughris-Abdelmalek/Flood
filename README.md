# Flood

Flood is a mobile application developed during a hackathon that allows users to get the carbon footprint of products by scanning their barcodes.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

`npm install`


To run the Expo app, use the command:

`npm start`


You also need to download the Expo client at https://expo.dev/client.

Flood relies on the following dependencies:

- Expo: A set of tools and libraries for building native iOS, Android, and web applications with React Native.
- Axios: A popular library for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Native: A framework for building native mobile applications using React.
- Translate: A lightweight library for translating text in JavaScript applications.

## Usage

To use Flood, simply scan the product's barcode using your device's camera (on iOS) or the app (on Android). The app will then display the carbon footprint of the scanned product.
